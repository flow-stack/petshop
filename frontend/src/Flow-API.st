## APIClient

This is a client to the backend API

Provides access to the expected REST and WebSocket API at the backend side. 

This client also has knows which objects are being published locally so they can be used remotely!

Instances of RemoteReference are used when you cannot send as copy an object that is the answer of some remote command.

## A WebSocketCommand is an abstraction.

Subclasses are concrete objects that easily travel 

1. from the frontend to the backend and/or 

2. come from the backend to the frontend.

They have the concrete knowledge of how to react or who to delegate behaviour.

They also carry any information necessary to achieve some reaction at their destination.

It's a convention that commands without @answer are yet to be executed, and all executed commands have an answer set (they're an exception if they need to)

Note: they are Mapless only as convenience for traveling over the wire. You can if you like to but, originally, they are not meant to be persisted.!
